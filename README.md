# Employee-Tracker-app

## Description 
I wanted to create an employee tracker database so that there is an amazing way to keep track of department, roles, and employees in any company. This database could be essential to a small, medium, or large business to keep track of salaries, budgets, employees with the ability to track new hires or new departments and new roles. It gives a company the ability to keep their own records and not having to outsource an application such as this to a consultant. I learned how to use mysql database and create tables, connect tables, and merge data into tables with similar attributes. 

## Installation 
Upon opening the application you begin in the command line typing in node index.js and this will give you the options to begin the employee tracker. When you first open the application you will need to SOURCE schema.sql and seeds.sql. Also, you will need to npm install your pacakge.json. Then the fun will begin.

## Usage
I have provided a walkthrough video to demonstrate once you begin with node index.js in the command line. Then you will be given a list of options to choose from. You can walk thru each option even with the ability to add and update.
